# GSoC 2025 Final Submission: Microkernel Architecture for Drop-in Plugins

* **Contributor:** Jai Pannu
* **Organization:** The Palisadoes Foundation
* **Project:** Talawa

---

## 1. Project Summary

This project successfully designed and implemented a microkernel-based, drop-in plugin system for the Talawa ecosystem. The new architecture enables the seamless integration of new features (like payments, analytics, and AI tools) without modifying the core `talawa-api`, `talawa-admin`, or mobile app codebases.

The system includes a dedicated plugin manager to handle plugin discovery, activation, and management. As discussed and agreed upon with my mentors, a streamlined plugin upload functionality and zipping scripts were implemented to provide an easy and secure way for administrators to manage plugins, in place of the originally proposed CDN-backed store.

## 2. Key Deliverables

This project met all its original goals, delivering:

1.  **A Core Microkernel Architecture:** A robust system built into the `talawa-api`, `talawa-admin` and `talawa-mobile` platforms to manage the entire plugin lifecycle.
2.  **Containerization for AI/ML Plugins:** A scalable solution for deploying and managing complex AI models, demonstrated with the T5 Summarizer plugin.
3.  **Three Ready-to-Use Plugins:**
    * **Razorpay Plugin:** A fully functional payment gateway for processing transactions.
    * **Google T5 Summarizer:** An AI plugin (using Hugging Face models) to summarize text content.
    * **Plugin Map for Developers:** A utility plugin to provide a clear map and guide for future community contributors building their own plugins.
